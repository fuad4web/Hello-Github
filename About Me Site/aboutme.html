                  <h3>THE ATTITUDE I EXHIBIT</h3>
                  <p>I respect people a lot, no matter how small you are or how big you are, am going to give you your utmost respect you deserved even if you are exhibiting the behaviour that you didnt deserve it, i will still show it to you</p>
                  <P>Am a guy that usually exhibit some bad ad good behaviours but the bad aspect i know about my self was that am a Non-Challant being but to my self not to others because i think am a generous being and people do talk about it very well. If i have a thing you are asking of even though i want to use it, i will still like giving it out to you all in the name of i wanna collect and gather some good rewards in front of allah on the day of Judgement.</P>
                  <p>I get frustrated and angry easily if am teaching someone and that perso couldnt quickly grab it because i do teach in a way that even if am talking to an infant child, he/she is going to undestand, now tell me how will an Adult will still be complaining telling me that he/she did not understand, i will just stop teaching staight forward and not heeding to anyone advice. If i see that am on the right track or i feel like doing something, no matter what people are saying about that thing, i wont change my mind at all but i will be teling  my self that <q>I wanna try even though i could fail</q>.</p>
                  <P>I easily hate people who engage in any negative character and even if they are my friend i will always overlook them as if i didnt know them before and i like people that are serious a lot, no matter where the person is coming from, maybe a guy or lady, i always fall in love with them just like you that you are reading this page</P>
                  <p>I love football seriously that sometimes i dreamt of football becuase i do play football on the pitch with my friends and i do watch football, i do this even during the time i supposed to use to learn some important things am gonna add to me life but i will try not to skip the match.</p>
                  <p>Am not the type of person that usually mean people and i dont spoil people at their back but what i do is that if that person exhibit one negative character, i will tell theperson immediately and if the person didnt answer then i wont relate to that person again like i usualy do.</p>

            <h3>Did you wanna know about me and my relatives?</h3>
            <div class="mystory">
                <p>My name is Abdul-hammed Fuad Opeyemi, i was born on 1st of November, 2000 at Alausa Ikeja. I am dark in complexion and quite tall but i am the type that is very quite and cool in nature, isn't that interesting?. The name of my dad is Mr Abdulhammed while the name of my Mum is Mrs Abdul-Azeez. My Dad is from Osun State but live at Cote d'voire for almost all his tender age while My Mum was born and raise up at Ibadan. We are 5 in our Family excluding My dad and mum and i am the 4th born which happens to be second to the last child. I have an elder sister who i love so much because she is always smily and always helping people with her sincere heart and the advice she usuallygive to me is that <q>Always think of good to people because it will eventually fall back to you</q>. i love her so much that the day she is going to her husband house, i was like why did this man marry he now, i was very happy for her and sad for my self, can't you see is quite funny.</p>
                <p>After my elder sister is the breadwinner of my Family (Brother Habeeb), very simple guy and dont take shit, i love him because he always open up to me very well and always tell me some paths i should take in my career then i have another sister again which is Sister Barakat, she is the only person that went to boarding school among us and she don't spend much with us because she always attend Modrasat but a week can't go by and she won't give me a call (is not possible), she will always call or text me on Wattsapp if she doesn't have card. Then i was born followed by my junior brother called IBRAHIM. My Family is very very interesting especially if we are with our Dad, he will always make you laugh becuase he his very funny and get angry easily. I have many Clerics but i went to a Modrasat throughout my prime at Lagos because that was where we are residing, at Ikorodu to be precise, they all give me call if am not around becuase i feel loved by them and i love them all also.</p>
                <p>The name of my best friend is <q>Omolola Folajimi</q> which happens to be my secondary school mate then at Elihans College but the person that is close to him is <q>Ngwuta Desmond Chidiebere</q>, i love Jimi because he understands me but i don't know why i love Desmond, i just like that guy but the funniest part is that they are both Programmers in which one of them is on it and the second one is dreaming of becoming one and i pray they will be sucessful including me myself and you that are reading this stuff.</p>
