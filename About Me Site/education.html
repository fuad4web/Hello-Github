           <h3>MY SCHOOLS</h3>
           <p>The first school i start my Creche and K.G class from is <q>De-Guidiance Nursery and Primary School</q> at Agric. I was very brilliant and loved by most teachers to the extent that they do gave me some stuffs just for me to eat or take home. The second school i went to was <q>Ola-Quranic Comprehensive High School</q> because of change of area, this is where i finished my Primary education and eventually i am the Head boy of my set but i couldn't wait to do it because of the Entrance exam i did to <q>Elihans College</q> which happens to be the school i start and finish my secondary school education and eventually am the Health Prefect Boy of my set in which i carry out my activities dilligently. I gained admission into THE POLYTECHNIC, IBADAN located at Oyo State which i think am just like a average student there but all thanks to Almighty God.</p>
           <h3>MY STRUGLES AT SCHOOL</h3>
           <p>At my Primary School i.e Ola-Quranic School, i do excel in every subject except Mathe-Matics this same problem occur to me when i we want to seat for Prefect exam then with English of 20 marks and Maths with the same mark, i excel excellenty in English but my Maths was a different story though i later passed it then when the two results was merged together, this same story occur to me in my Secondary School till i get to Senior School one in which i met with the best teacher of my Life {Mr Damilola} who tried everything possible to teach me and with God i know Maths to the extent that some are coming to me and begging God to just know half of what i know at Maths but to me i know nothing.</p>
           <p>The paying of my School fees is part of what i have problem with because am from a average family in which if the end of the term is approaching i will be thinking about it seriously that it will even affect my performance at Exam all because i was enroll to the best School in my Area. I thank God i didn't put my parents to shame. </p>
           <p>The next struggle i have is when i got admitted to The Polytechnic, Ibadan. is the ay of living and probably life at School, so boring and stressful but i got no option but to move forward, i learn many things about Life but my biggest regret is me not understanding anything about Programming because it reduce my CGPA seriously. My ND1 i was at 4. forward almost at distinction but my ND2, i performed woefully because i didn't know programming and it affected me a lot because it is a 3 unit course but all thanks to God that i didn't have extra year but i could have done better if i see a Guru to teach me then. </p>
